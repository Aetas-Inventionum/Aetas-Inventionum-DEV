Github Desktop Install Guide
1. Launch the EU4 Launcher and navigate to the "Upload a Mod" button in "All installed mods", then click "Create a Mod". 
2. In the following panel, name the folder that will be created "Aetas-Inventionum-DEV" (without the quotes). Tags, version, and name do not matter.
3. Navigate to the folder you just made and move the "descriptor.mod" file elsewhere, do NOT delete it as you will need it again.
4. Launch Github Desktop and navigate to the "Current repository" button below File/Edit/etc, then click "add". You will be able to select the "Aetas-Inventionum-DEV" repository either in the list on the Github.com tab, or to find it manually by pasting the URL to the repository in to the box on the URL tab. 
5. In the "Local path" field at the bottom of the "Clone a repository" panel, you should change the path to direct to your EU4 mod folder (not your newly created mod's folder). It will look something like this "C:\Users\USER\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Europa Universalis IV\mod" (without the quotes) but may differ depending on your personal circumstances.
6. Press "clone", the blue button at the bottom of the "Clone a repository" panel, and then give the program time to copy the mod's files onto your computer.
7. Navigate to the folder you made with the EU4 Launcher and move the "descriptor.mod" file back into it, you should now be able to launch the mod.
